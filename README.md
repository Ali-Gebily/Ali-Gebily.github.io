#### How to run the project 
1. Download XAMPP , install it and start the server.
2. Download the zip(d3-status-report-generation.zip) folder from the TC submission. Uncompress it.
3. For Mac OS X go to the folder `Application → XAMPP → htdocs`. Put the uncompressed folder inside htdocs folder. 

4. For windows go to the installed path of XAMPP and search for `tomcat\webapps` folder. Put the uncompressed folder. In my case it is C:\xampp\tomcat\webapps\

5. Start from the browser by providing the path of the folder with localhost prefix.  
For MAC OS:  `http://localhost/d3-status-report-generation/`   
For windows :`http://localhost:8080/d3-status-report-generation/`

Note : In your case the port may be different.
6. Now you will see an interface, where you can upload the file either by `Drag and Drop` or by `Select File` the file.
7. Click on `Generate Report`. 

#### Additional feature
1. `Drag and Drop` option for uploading the file.
2. `Mentioned the ids in the Gantt Chart` so that even after taking a print out in grey scale it will be easier to link the chart with the data.
